Final result:
After receiving the input and outputs from all agents, I have combined the metadata and RNA insights into a clean, human-readable 1-page markdown summary report. Here is the

# OSD-120 Summary Report
=====================================

## Introduction

The OSTI study OSD-120, conducted on Arabidopsis thaliana, aimed to investigate the genetic dissection of the spaceflight transcriptome. The study used various protocols and platforms, 
including growth protocol, sample collection, Nucleic Acid Extraction, Library Construction, Nucleic Acid Sequencing, GeneLab raw data processing protocol, GeneLab RNAseq data processing 
protocol, and Image Analysis.

## Study Details
---------------

*   **Dataset ID:** OSD-120
*   **Organism:** Arabidopsis thaliana
*   **Mission Number:** S, p, a, c, e, X, - (not specified)
*   **Funding Agency:** Center for Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), Grant #GA-2013-104

## RNA Insights
-----------------

Based on the top 10 expressed RNA genes, obtained using the `osdr_viz_tools_osdr_plot_top_rna` tool call:

*   AT3G41768: 10,209,304 counts
*   ATMG00020: 9,157,285 counts
*   AT1G07590: 3,233,395 counts
*   AT5G60390: 2,407,385 counts
*   AT3G06355: 2,241,945 counts
*   AT5G02500: 1,717,760 counts
*   AT4G13940: 1,655,880 counts
*   AT3G08580: 1,645,226 counts
*   AT1G21310: 1,606,477 counts
*   AT3G16640: 1,603,939 counts

A bar plot of these top 10 expressed RNA genes can be found in the file `OSD-120_top10_rna.png`.
